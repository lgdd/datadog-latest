This feature allows the Go tracer to compute aggregated span statistics locally before sending them to the Datadog Agent, resulting in reduced network traffic and improved performance.\r\n\r\nWhat this means: Instead of sending all raw span data to the Agent, the tracer now sends pre-computed statistics, reducing bandwidth usage while maintaining full observability.\r\n\r\nTo disable, if needed: Set the environment variable `DD_TRACE_STATS_COMPUTATION_ENABLED=false` or use `tracer.WithStatsComputation(false)` when starting the tracer programmatically.\r\n\r\n#### File-based Configurations\r\nIntroduced support for configuring SDK products via a file on the underlying Linux system. [#3438](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/pull/3438) [Documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/automatic_instrumentation/configure_apm_features_linux/#sdk-version-requirements)\r\n\r\n#### Baggage improvements\r\nFixed a distributed tracing bug in the baggage propagator. Also refactored baggage injection and extraction logic for improved performance and readability. [#3439](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/pull/3439) [#3597](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/pull/3597)\r\n\r\n### Application Security Management (ASM)\r\n\r\ncontrib envoyproxy/go-control-plane:\r\n* API Security\r\n  * Proxy sampler has been implemented for schema generation\r\n  * Support of Json body analysis of requests and responses (using simdjson-go or fallbacking on json-iterator/go if not available)\r\n* Appsec\r\n  * Support of Envoy observability_mode for async and non-blocking requests analysis\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Application
