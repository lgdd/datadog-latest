  "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This is a patch release of the last `v1` version before the v1 transitional release `v1.74.0` planned for May/June 2025. The Go tracer v1 transitional version is essentially a wrapper that preserves the API from v1 but uses v2 under the hood. \r\n> \r\n> The transitional version can co-exist with v2 in the same service, which enables you to migrate services gradually. Using the v1 transitional version - starting at `v1.74.0` - doesn’t require any code changes, but it also won’t support any new features of the new v2 tracer.\r\n> \r\n> The v1 transitional version is planned for release in late May/early June 2025 as v1.74.0.\r\n\r\n### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)\r\n* fix(ddtrace/internal): log to debug instead of warning when starting spans without an active tracer by @darccio https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/pull/3513\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/compare/v1.73.0...v1.73.1",
