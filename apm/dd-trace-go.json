  "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\nThis patch release fixes a significant bug that caused dropped spans due to local sampling rules overriding the sampling decision already present in inbound distributed trace context.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT] \r\n> Depending on your sampling rules, and especially if you have trace sampling rules,, you may notice an increase in ingested spans. This increase is expected and the consequence of not applying trace sampling rules when there is a head sampling decision. If the ingested volume is problematic, reduce it using [APM Ingestion Controls](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_controls/). For any questions or issues, please contact [Datadog Support](https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/).\r\n\r\n### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)\r\n* fix(ddtrace/tracer): keep correct trace+span sampling with propagated sampling decision by @darccio in #3856 \r\n* chore: update the remoteconfig dependency by @andreimatei in #3883\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/compare/v2.2.2...v2.2.3",
