  "body": "This version introduces breaking changes and improvements. There is no special significance behind the version number, the shift to v1.0.0 reflects breaking changes and new feature updates.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n- **API Update**: Major updates to the tracer API. This may require modifications to existing integrations.  [#131](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/131) by [@dmehala](https://github.com/dmehala)\r\n- **Separation of public and private headers**: Public and private headers have been reorganized, leading to a cleaner structure. Public headers are now located in `include/` directory.  [#144](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/144) by [@dmehala](https://github.com/dmehala)\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n- **Bug Fix**: Trimmed inspected headers to improve performance and accuracy. [#137](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/137) by [@dmehala](https://github.com/dmehala)\r\n- **New Feature**: Ensured that `tracecontext` headers take precedence over Datadog headers (AIT-10281).  [#142](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/142) by [@zacharycmontoya](https://github.com/zacharycmontoya)\r\n- **Refactor**: Refined Remote Configuration support to enhance stability. [#130](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/130) by [@dmehala](https://github.com/dmehala)\r\n- **Dependency Update**: Bumped `libcurl` to version 8.8.0.  [#135](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/135) by [@dmehala](https://github.com/dmehala)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\nWe are thrilled to welcome the following new contributors to the project:\r\n- [@cbeauchesne](https://github.com/cbeauchesne) made their first contribution in [#139](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/139)\r\n- [@zacharycmontoya](https://github.com/zacharycmontoya) made their first contribution in [#142](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/142)\r\n- [@cataphract](https://github.com/cataphract) made their first contribution in [#143](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/143)\r\n- [@dubloom](https://github.com/dubloom) made their first contribution in [#153](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/153)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: [Compare v0.2.2...v1.0.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/compare/v0.2.2...v1.0.0)",
