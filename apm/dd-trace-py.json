  "body": "### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  - AAP\r\n      - This fix resolves an issue where track_user was generating additional unexpected security activity for customers.\r\n  - Tracing\r\n      - This resolves a ``TypeError`` in encoding when truncating a large bytes object.\r\n  - LLM Observability\r\n      - Resolved an issue where manual instrumentation would raise ``DD_LLMOBS_ML_APP`` missing errors when LLM Observability was disabled.\r\n      - litellm: This fix resolves an out of bounds error when handling streamed responses. This error occurred when the number of choices in a streamed response was not set as a keyword argument.\r\n  - Dynamic Instrumentation\r\n      - Fixed an incompatibility issue with code origin that caused line probes on the entry point functions to fail to instrument.\r\n",
