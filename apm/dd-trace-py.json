  "body": "Estimated end-of-life date, accurate to within three months: 08-2026\r\nSee [the support level definitions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for more information.\r\n\r\nVersions 3.12.1 through 3.12.4 did not include the full set of updates originally delivered in 3.12.0. As a result, several enhancements — including the critical profiling fix described below — were not present in those patch releases.\r\n\r\nWith 3.12.5, all updates are now fully aligned and included. We recommend upgrading directly to 3.12.5 to ensure you have the complete set of improvements and fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- profiling: This fixes a performance regression where the memory profiler's collector thread would spin in a tight loop, consuming nearly a full CPU core."
