  "body": "### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Code Security:\r\n    - Fixes critical memory safety issue in IAST when used with forked worker processes (MCP servers with Gunicorn and Uvicorn). Workers previously crashed with segmentation faults due to stale PyObject pointers in native taint maps after fork.\r\n\r\n- tracing:\r\n    - Resolves a potential deadlock when forking.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability:\r\n    - Fixes an issue where the Google ADK integration would throw an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `name` or `description` attributes of a tool.\r\n\r\n- AAP:\r\n    - This fix resolves an issue where the appsec layer was not compatible anymore with the lambda/serverless version of the tracer.\r\n\r\n- lib-injection:\r\n    - do not inject into the `gsutil` tool\r\n\r\n- profiling:\r\n    - improve reliability when parsing an empty span.\r\n    - This fix resolves a critical issue where the Lock Profiler generated release samples for non-sampled lock acquires, resulting in inflated or negative (when integer overflows) lock hold times (e.g., \"3.24k days per minute\", \"-970 days per minute\"). This affected virtually all customers using sampling rates \\< 100% (which should be the majority).\r\n    - This fix prevents a use-after-free crash from the memory profiler on Python version 3.10 and 3.11. The previous attempt to fix this bug itself had a bug, which this fix addresses.\r\n    - Fixes a segmentation fault caused by accessing `frame.f_locals` while trying to retrieve class name of a `PyFrameObject`."
