  "body": "Estimated end-of-life date, accurate to within three months: 05-2027\r\nSee [the support level definitions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n- dynamic instrumentation\r\n  - log probes now use the debugger intake track. This requires Datadog agent version 7.49.0 or above.\r\n- CI Visibility\r\n  - Official release of the new version of the pytest plugin, with architectural improvements. This new version uses an independent span writer for Test Optimization (similar to the `DD_CIVISIBILITY_USE_BETA_WRITER` option), and also contains performance and memory usage improvements. A beta version of the plugin had been available since v4.2.0, and could be enabled via the `DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN` environment variable. This new version is now the default, and the environment variable can be used to revert to the previous plugin if used with false or 0 values.                                                                \r\n\r\n### Deprecation Notes\r\n\r\n- tracing\r\n  - `DD_TRACE_128_BIT_TRACEID_GENERATION_ENABLED` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.0.0. 128-bit trace ID generation will become mandatory.\r\n- The `tracer` parameter is deprecated in the following functions and class methods and will be removed in version 5.0.0:\r\n  - aiohttp: `trace_app`\r\n  - asgi: `TraceMiddleware.__init__`\r\n  - bottle: `TracePlugin.__init__`\r\n  - cherrypy: `TraceMiddleware.__init__`\r\n  - falcon: `TraceMiddleware.__init__`\r\n  - flask_cache: `get_traced_cache`\r\n  - sqlalchemy: `trace_engine`\r\n  - wsgi: `WSGIMiddleware.__init__`\r\n\r\n  The `ddtrace.trace.tracer` singleton is always used.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- profiling\r\n  - It is now possible to profile applications using `uvloop` with `asyncio`.\r\n- pymongo\r\n  - Adds support for tracing pymongo 4.12+ AsyncMongoClient operations. The integration now automatically instruments both synchronous and asynchronous clients when using pymongo \\>= 4.12.\r\n- Code Security (IAST)\r\n  - This introduces support for Python 3.14 template strings (PEP-750). Template strings (t-strings) are now tracked for taint propagation, enabling detection of security vulnerabilities when user input is embedded in template strings.\r\n- claude_agent_sdk\r\n  - Introduces tracing support for the Claude Agent SDK's `query`, `ClaudeSDKClient.query`, and `ClaudeSDKClient.receive_messages` methods. See [the docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#claude-agent-sdk) for more information.\r\n- opentelemetry: Adds support for the `start_as_current_span` decorator on asynchronous functions. Requires opentelemetry-api\\>=1.24.\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Adds LLM Observability tracing support for Claude Agent SDK requests.              \r\n  - Adds Azure OpenAI as a supported provider for the LLM Judge evaluator.\r\n  - Adds Vertex AI as a supported provider for the LLM Judge evaluator.                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n  - Introduces the `LLMObs.async_experiment()` method for running experiments with async task functions and mixed sync/async evaluators.                       \r\n  - Adds built-in evaluators for common evaluation tasks. The following evaluators are now available:\r\n    - `StringCheckEvaluator`: Performs string comparison operations (equals, not equals, contains, case-insensitive contains).\r\n    - `RegexMatchEvaluator`: Validates output against regex patterns with search, match, or fullmatch modes.\r\n    - `LengthEvaluator`: Validates output length constraints by characters, words, or lines.\r\n    - `JSONEvaluator`: Validates JSON syntax and optionally checks for required keys.\r\n    - `SemanticSimilarityEvaluator`: Measures semantic similarity between output and expected output using embedding vectors.\r\n  - Adds support for `json` metric type in evaluation metrics. Users can now submit `dict` values as evaluation metrics using `LLMObs.submit_evaluation()` with `metric_type=\"json\"`. Additionally, experiment evaluators that return `dict` values are automatically detected as `json` metric type.\r\n  - Adds `LLMJudge` evaluator for automated evaluation of LLM outputs using another LLM as the judge. Supports OpenAI and Anthropic providers with boolean, score, categorical, and custom JSON schema output formats.\r\n  - Adds AWS Bedrock as a supported provider for the LLM Judge evaluator.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- lib injection\r\n  - the injected `site-packages` directory is now added as the last entry in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (it previously was added before the last entry).\r\n- profiling\r\n  - A race condition that could lead to out-of-bounds access in the Profiler was fixed.\r\n  - A bug where the Stack Profiler could loop infinitely (and allocate large amounts of memory, leading to crashes) when sampling `asyncio` Tasks has been fixed.\r\n  - Fixes crashes in the memory profiler caused by re-entering the Python interpreter from inside CPython's allocator hook.\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where stack profiler could hold frame references to greenlets, which could have already completed. This could delay garbage collecting local variables from the greenlet.\r\n  - A bug where corrupted or circular stack chunk linked lists on Python 3.11+ could cause infinite recursion during stack unwinding was fixed.\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where the dropped frames indicator frame could be added multiple times when exporting the same sample repeatedly, resulting in duplicate `\"<N frame(s) omitted>\"` entries in profiling data and unbounded memory growth in the memory profiler.\r\n- internal\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where ddtrace ignored the uwsgi `--skip-atexit` flag and registered Python atexit handlers regardless. This caused profiler cleanup code to run during process shutdown even when `--skip-atexit` was set, leading to crashes and hangs in uwsgi workers.\r\n- tracing\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where traces may not be flushed during the handling of `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signals.\r\n- telemetry\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where telemetry events may not be flushed during the handling of `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signals.\r\n  - handle closed logging streams in writer background threads\r\n- AAP\r\n  - Add the `noopener` and `noreferrer` link tags in the Datadog link in the footer of the App and API Protection HTML blocking response template.\r\n    This could previously trigger a \"reverse tabnabbing\" vulnerability finding from other security analysis tools.\r\n- DSM\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where malformed DSM payloads prevented data from being reported when `DD_EXPERIMENTAL_PROPAGATE_PROCESS_TAGS_ENABLED` was enabled."
