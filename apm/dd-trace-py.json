Previously, the trace context created by the first `annotation_context` remained active after exiting, causing the second context to reuse a stale context ID. This resulted in annotations not being applied to spans after the first batch call in the second `annotation_context` block.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- profiling: the Profiler now always uses the name of leaf tasks for the \"Task name\" label. Previously, one of the Stacks would be labelled with the parent task's name, which would lead to inconsistent behaviour across runs.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- profiling: a bug causing crashes when using `uvloop` and forking has been resolved.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- profiling: This improves the accuracy of stacks for on-CPU asyncio Tasks by reducing the odds of Frames for a Task polluting the stack of other Tasks.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- profiling: This fix resolves an issue where memory profiler module fails to load when the system doesn't have libatomic installed."
