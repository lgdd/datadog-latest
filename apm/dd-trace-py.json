  "body": "Estimated end-of-life date, accurate to within three months: 08-2026\r\nSee [the support level definitions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- CI Visibility: This fix resolves performance issue affecting coverage collection for Python 3.12+\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Corrected the description of the `assessment` argument in `submit_evaluation()`.\r\n    `assessment` now refers to whether the evaluation itself passes or fails according to your application, rather than the validity of the evaluation result.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where the `langchain` integration would incorrectly mark Azure OpenAI calls as duplicate llm operations even if the `openai` integration was enabled. The `langchain` integration will trace Azure OpenAI spans as workflow spans if there is an equivalent llm span from the `openai` integration.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- IAST: Fixed an issue where using weak hashing or cipher algorithms outside of a request context (e.g., during application startup) could raise an unhandled exception. The fix ensures proper error handling when IAST operations are performed without an active request context.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- profiling: Upgrades echion to resolve an issue where stack profiler can allocate a large amount of memory unnecessarily. Resolves another issue where the profiler can loop infinitely on Python 3.13."
