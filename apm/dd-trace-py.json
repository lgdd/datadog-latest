  "body": "Estimated end-of-life date, accurate to within three months: 08-2026\r\nSee [the support level definitions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: Experiments can now be created to be stored under a different project from the project defined in `LLMObs.enable`\r\n\r\n### Deprecation Notes\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for()` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It will be replaced with `LLMObs.submit_evaluation()` which will take the signature of the original `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for()` method in ddtrace version 4.0. Please use `LLMObs.submit_evaluation()` for submitting evaluations moving forward.\r\n  To migrate:\r\n    - `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(...)` users: rename to `LLMObs.submit_evaluation(...)`\r\n    - `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(...)` users: rename the `span_context` argument to `span`, i.e. `LLMObs.submit_evaluation(span_context={\"span_id\": ..., \"trace_id\": ...}, ...)` to `LLMObs.submit_evaluation(span={\"span_id\": ..., \"trace_id\": ...}, ...)`\r\n- tracing: `Tracer.on_start_span` and `Tracer.deregister_on_start_span` are deprecated and will be removed in v4.0.0 with no planned replacement.\r\n- Support for ddtrace with Python 3.8 is deprecated and will be removed in version 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- CI Visibility: This introduces Test Impact Analysis code coverage support for Python 3.13.\r\n- azure_eventhubs: Add support for Azure Event Hubs producers.\r\n- azure_functions: Add support for Event Hubs triggers.\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Introduces automatic tracing context propagation for LLM Observability traces involving asynchronous tasks created via `asyncio.create_task()`.\r\n  - The `asyncio` and `futures` integrations are now enabled by default on `LLMObs.enable()`, which enables asynchronous context propagation for those libraries.\r\n  - The `LLMObs.submit_evaluation()` and `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for()` methods now accept a `reasoning` argument to denote an explanation of the evaluation results.\r\n  - The OpenAI integration now submits LLM spans to LLM Observability for `parse()` methods used for structured outputs.\r\n  - The `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for()` method now accepts a `assessment` argument to denote\r\n    whether or not the evaluation is valid or correct. Accepted values are either `\"pass\"` or `\"fail\"`.\r\n- openai: Adds support for tracing the `parse()` methods for structured outputs on `chat.completions` and `responses` endpoints (available in OpenAI SDK \\>= 1.92.0).\r\n- AAP\r\n  - This introduces `track_user_id` in the ATO SDK, which is equivalent to `track_user` but does not require the login, only the user id.\r\n  - This introduces supports for custom scanners for data classification.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- AAP\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where downstream request analysis would not match headers in rules when using `requests` with `urllib3\\<2`.\r\n  - This PR is a tentative fix for rare memory problems with libddwaf that we were unable to reproduce for now.\r\n- Pin to `wrapt<2` until we can ensure full compatibility with the breaking changes.\r\n- CI Visibility\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where tests would be incorrectly detected as third-party code if a third-party package containing a folder with the same name as the tests folder was installed. For instance, the `sumy` package installs files under `tests/*` in `site-packages`, and this would cause any modules under `tests.*` to be considered third-party.\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue with our coverage implementation for Python versions 3.12+ that affects generated bytecode that isn't mapped to a line in the code\r\n- LLM Observability: Resolves an issue with the Google GenAI integration where processing token metrics would sometimes be skipped if the LLM message had no text part.\r\n- grpc: This fix resolves an issue where the internal span was left active in the caller when using the future interface.\r\n- Profiling: prevent potential deadlocks with thread pools.\r\n- ray\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where submitting Ray jobs caused an `AttributeError` crash in certain configurations.\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where long-running job spans could remain unfinished when an exception occurred during job submission.\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where long-running spans did not preserve the correct resource name when being recreated.\r\n- otel: Ensures the `/v1/logs` path is correctly added to prevent log payloads from being dropped by the Agent when using `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` configuration. Metrics and traces are unaffected."
