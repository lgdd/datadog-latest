The integration now gracefully handles both the original response format and wrapped responses by falling back to ddtrace's own stream wrapping when needed.\r\n- profiling\r\n    - A bug where `asyncio` task stacks could contain duplicated frames when the task was on-CPU is now fixed. The stack now correctly shows each frame only once.\r\n    - This fix resolves an issue where memory profiler flamegraphs were upside down."
