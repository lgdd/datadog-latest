The version field is now omitted unless explicitly set by the user.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- openai: This fix resolves an issue where using async iteration with paginated methods (e.g., `async for model in client.models.list()`) caused a `TypeError: 'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method, got coroutine`. See [issue \\#14574](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/14574).\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- langchain: Fixes an issue where streamed responses that end before the first chunk is received would result in an `IndexError`.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- Fix a potential race condition in the tracer.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- Fix the Python Detector regular expression so it also detects paths ending with only the major version number.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- logging: Fixed ddtrace internal logging when trace-log correlation is disabled. Prevents `ValueError: Formatting field not found in record: 'dd.service'`."
