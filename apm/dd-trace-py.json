  "body": "Estimated end-of-life date, accurate to within three months: 08-2026\r\nSee [the support level definitions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for more information.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- google-adk: Adds APM tracing and LLM Observability support for the Google ADK library (google-adk). Support includes APM tracing and LLM Observability for agent runs, tool calls, and code execution.\r\n- django: This introduces the `DD_DJANGO_TRACING_MINIMAL` environment variable for performance-sensitive applications. When enabled, this disables Django ORM, cache, and template instrumentation while keeping middleware instrumentation enabled. This significantly reduces overhead by removing Django-specific spans while preserving visibility into the underlying database drivers, cache clients, and other integrations. For example, with this enabled, Django ORM query spans are disabled but database driver spans (e.g., psycopg, MySQLdb) will still be created. To enable minimal tracing, set `DD_DJANGO_TRACING_MINIMAL=true`.\r\n- AWS: adds `aws.partition` tag onto AWS traces based on the region for the boto, botocore, and aiobotocore integrations.\r\n- AAP: This extends downstream request analysis (API10) to the requests package. Previously, downstream request analysis was only supported in the standard cpython api (urllib).\r\n- dynamic instrumentation/exception replay/code origin for spans: added support for the latest Datadog agent intake for snapshots. This requires a minimum agent version of 7.49.0.\r\n- CI Visibility: This introduces the env var `DD_CIVISIBILITY_ENABLED` (with default value True) so it can be disabled to avoid sending traces to the Test Visibility product from the test runners.\r\n- azure_servicebus: Add distributed tracing support for sending batches with Azure Service Bus producers.\r\n- azure_functions: Use span links to connect Service Bus trigger consumers to the producers that send the messages.\r\n- tracing: Added support for resource renaming, an experimental feature that lets the Datadog platform adjust the resource field on web request spans when the endpoint cannot be correctly deduced. Enable the feature by setting `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_RENAMING_ENABLED=\"true\"`\r\n- Code Security (IAST)\r\n  - Untrusted Serialization detection, which will be displayed on your DataDog Vulnerability Explorer dashboard. See the [Application Vulnerability Management](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/vulnerability_management/) documentation for more information about this feature.\r\n  - Reduce false positives if md5 or sha1 functions have the parameter `usedforsecurity=False`.\r\n- LLM Observability: Extends the prompt structure to add `tags` and `chat_template`, and a new `Prompt` TypedDict class that would be used in annotation and annotation_context.\r\n- LLM Observability: Datasets & Experiments SDK now has summary evaluators support.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- CI Visibility: This fix solves an issue where the ITR skip count metric was aggregating skipped tests even when skipping level was set to suite. It will now count appropriately (skipped suites or skipped tests) depending on ITR skip level.\r\n- sampling: This change prevents the `DatadogSampler` from getting recreated whenever the `SpanAggregator` is reset, and instead updates the rate limiter that the sampler uses.\r\n- dynamic instrumentation: fix an issue that prevented multiple probes on the same location from being instrumented.\r\n- exception replay\r\n  - prevent Celery from crashing when a task raises a custom exception with mandatory arguments.\r\n  - ensure that value capture starts from the leaf frame of the innermost exception.\r\n- tracing: Fixes encoding bytes objects as span attributes by truncating byte string, rather than throwing `PyErr_Format`.\r\n- AAP\r\n  - This fix resolves an issue where the endpoint discovery feature could generate a crash for flask at startup.\r\n  - This fix disables grpc threat monitoring, as it could generate false positives.\r\n- libinjection: allow python module executed with `-m` entries in the denylist.\r\n- profiling\r\n  - Upgrades echion to resolve segmentation faults that can happen on services with a lot of `asyncio.Task`s.\r\n  - Fix crash in memory profiling when garbage collection is triggered while sampling a `PyObject_Realloc` call, which can lead to accessing freed memory.\r\n  - Profiling won't load if `--skip-atexit` is not set when `--lazy` or `--lazy-apps` is set on uWSGI\\<2.0.30. This is to prevent crashes from profiling native extension modules. See <https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/pull/2726> for details.\r\n- RemoteConfig: Fixes an issue introduced in Python 3.13 where creating a shared array with the `c_char` type raised a `TypeError`, this now uses the 'c' typecode for better compatibility across versions.\r\n- source code integration: check that `DD_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` and `DD_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL` are defined before using the git command."
