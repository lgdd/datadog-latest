This can interfere with analysis or instrumentation logic.\r\n- litellm: This fix resolves an issue where potentially sensitive parameters were being tagged as metadata on LLM Observability spans. Now, metadata tags are based on an allowlist instead of a denylist.\r\n- django: fix incorrect component tag being set for django orm spans"
