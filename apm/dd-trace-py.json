For instance, the `sumy` package installs files under `tests/*` in `site-packages`, and this would cause any modules under `tests.*` to be considered third-party.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- grpc: This fix resolves an issue where the internal span was left active in the caller when using the future interface.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- ray: This fix resolves an issue where submitting Ray jobs caused an `AttributeError` crash in certain configurations.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- ray: This fix resolves an issue where long-running spans did not preserve the correct resource name when being recreated.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- ray: This fix resolves an issue where long-running job spans could remain unfinished when an exception occurred during job submission.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- AAP: This PR is a tentative fix for rare memory problems with libddwaf that we were unable to reproduce for now.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n- Internal: Fix some modules being unloaded too soon when using pytest + ddtrace + gevent."
