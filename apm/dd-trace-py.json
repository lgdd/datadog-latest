  "body": "### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- AAP: resolves a bug where ASGI middleware would not catch the BlockingException raised by AAP because it was aggregated in an ExceptionGroup\r\n- AAP: This fix resolves an issue where the `route` parameter was not being correctly handled in the Django path function.\r\n- dynamic instrumentation: extended captured value redaction in mappings with keys of type `bytes`.\r\n- kafka: This fix resolves an issue where the <span class=\"title-ref\">list_topics</span> call in the Kafka integration could hang indefinitely. The integration now sets a 1-second timeout on <span class=\"title-ref\">list_topics</span> calls and caches both successful cluster ID results and failures (with a 5-minute retry interval) to prevent repeated slow metadata queries.\r\n- openai: Resolves an issue where an uninitialized `OpenAI/AsyncOpenAI` client would result in an `AttributeError`.\r\n- pydantic_ai: This fix resolves an issue where enabling the Pydantic AI for pydantic-ai-slim \\>= 0.4.4 would fail. See `this issue <https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/14161>`\\_ for more details.\r\n- Remote Config: Eagerly query Remote Config upon process startup to ensure timely configuration updates.\r\n- tracing: Fix inconsistent trace sampling during partial flush (traces \\>300 spans). Now correctly applies sampling rules to the root span instead of a random payload span. Since traces are sampled only once, using the wrong span could bypass sampling rules and cause the agent to apply default rate limits. Fixes regression introduced in v2.8.0.\r\n"
